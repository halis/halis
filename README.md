About halis.js
--------------------------------------

Currently, lo-dash (based on [underscore](http://underscorejs.org)) is the only dependency. In the future, this may be factored out as well, depending on how much of it is used. 

The idea of halis is to provide a jQuery-like API that relies more on native function calls, for speed. Also, various utility methods are provided for strings, dates, arrays and checking arguments.
